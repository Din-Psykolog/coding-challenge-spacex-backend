# Backend Coding Challenge

## Purpose

The purpose is to setup a Node.js server with 1 endpoint that gets data from a public API, modifies/filters the data and returns that as the response. Also important to be able to explain how the code came about and why you chose to solve things the way you did. Follow the steps below, keep the code clean and easy to understand and please **commit after each step**. Please don't fork the repo as that might simplify cheating. If anything is unclear, feel free to choose the way you prefer, or if too confusing just email me (reply to the email that sent you this coding challenge).

## Steps

1. Create a Node server project with Express.js
2. Fetch data from this public SpaceX API https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API, using https://api.spacexdata.com/v5/launches
3. Create an endpoint that returns the link to one random Flickr launch image (pick any launch with at least 1 flickr -> original picture, some launches have none)
4. If the SpaceX API can't be accessed the endpoint should return something useful

Acceptance Criteria: When running the server and accessing the endpoint, it should return a link to one Flickr launch image or an error message
Note: Remember to keep the code clean and commit after each step (or more often)

## Report

Finally, send an e-mail to me with a link to your Git repo and instructions for how to run it. In case you wanna keep it private, add me (ripern) as a collaborator temporarily.

Good luck!
